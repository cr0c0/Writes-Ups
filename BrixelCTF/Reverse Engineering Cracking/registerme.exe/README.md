# registerme.exe - 15PTS

### Prerequires:

- <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/x64dbg/" rel="nofollow">x64dbg, OllyDbg or random debugger</a>

-----------------

- When we open the registerme.exe, we got message that say "NOT REGISTERED!"

- So let's open a debugger, search all strings and you will get result like that:

- And at this moment I got the idea of creating file with the same name.

- I decided to re-open the executable and I got a button that say I can show the flag.
